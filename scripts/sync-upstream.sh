# omp upstream → GUI feature-sync.
#
# Merges the latest omp upstream into the current (GUI release) branch, then
# re-runs the GUI-specific rebuild steps a plain `git merge` can't do. Run from
# the repo root: `bash packages/gui/scripts/sync-upstream.sh`.
#
# Steps:
#   1. fetch upstream, show what's incoming
#   2. merge upstream/main (stop on conflict for manual resolution)
#   3. bun install (lockfile may have moved)
#   4. gen:stats (re-embed the stats dashboard client bundle)
#   5. build:omp (rebuild the bundled sidecar with upstream + local changes)
#   6. build the GUI renderer + typecheck + tests
