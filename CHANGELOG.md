# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Linux x64 packages**: an AppImage and a `.deb` for Ubuntu 24.04+, with the bundled sidecar, `omp://` links, the tray and window icon, and `latest-linux.yml` update metadata.
- **Linux CI**: type checks, unit tests and the GUI build run on Ubuntu for every push and pull request.

### Changed

- **Ctrl shortcuts on Linux and Windows**: ⌘-only shortcuts gain Ctrl twins and every chord displays as text, such as `Ctrl+Shift+T`. macOS is unchanged. On Windows, `Ctrl+T` now opens a tab and `Ctrl+W` closes one; thinking has no default key there and can be bound in Hotkeys.

### Fixed

- **Launch arguments on a cold start**: a workspace path or `omp://` link passed to a packaged Linux or Windows build is honored when the app was not running.
- **Deb updates**: a deb install runs only when you choose Restart & install, and a cancelled or failed install shows in the update banner.
- **AppImage updates**: Restart & install asks about working tabs before replacing the file, then starts the new version once the old one has quit.

## [0.9.10] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Windows x64 packaging**: download an NSIS installer or portable executable with the bundled `omp/18.3.0` sidecar.

### Changed

- **Cross-platform sidecar startup**: Windows resolves `omp.exe`, keeps the inherited tool environment, hides sidecar consoles, and registers the `omp://` protocol in installed builds.
- **Windows release metadata**: NSIS update metadata and blockmaps are generated alongside the installer and portable artifact.

### Fixed

- **Cross-platform icon generation**: Windows `.ico` output no longer requires macOS `iconutil`; macOS `.icns` generation remains unchanged.

## [0.9.9] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Coordination tool views**: `wait`, `read proc://…`, `write agent://…`, and process control writes now render as compact, structured cards instead of generic text or file operations.

### Changed

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 18.3.0**, including background-job coordination, wait/protocol support, explicit process cancellation, and Apple Foundation Models discovery on supported Apple Silicon systems.
- **Execution details stay bounded**: coordination cards summarize status and expose focused scrollable details without taking over the transcript.

### Fixed

- **Upstream protocol parity**: GUI tool dispatch now recognizes the current `wait` and internal `proc://`/`agent://` protocols while retaining legacy `hub` transcript rendering.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- **Bilingual feature tour**: refreshed English and Chinese documentation includes 24 matching-language screenshots captured with isolated, synthetic demo data.

### Changed

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 18.2.8** with expanded browser automation, buffered cloud transcription, faster credential scanning, and more reliable aborted LSP requests.
- **Smoother interactions**: streaming Markdown, common dialogs, popovers, hover feedback, and panel entrances stay visually stable as content updates.

### Fixed

- **Model and provider refresh**: switching models, signing in or out, and adding, editing, or removing custom providers update the originating session's model and account views without stale responses undoing newer state.
- **Live accounting**: context, cost, and cache values refresh during runs; measured context usage remains visible when model capacity is unknown.
- **Conversation follow**: new output follows the viewport at the bottom without pulling readers out of scrollback, and jump-to-latest reliably resumes following.
- **Settings and dialogs**: IME-safe keyboard handling, layered Escape behavior, focus recovery, confirmation dialogs, and scrollable layouts make controls more predictable.
- **Packaged startup and recovery**: bundled configuration dependencies are available at launch, custom-provider writes are atomic, and off-screen saved windows recover to usable bounds.
- **Statistics resilience**: unexpected list responses no longer crash the statistics view.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 18.2.7**: semantic `find` search, `^model` delegation, configurable specialist model roles, batch evaluation/judgment, and `omp stream` livestreaming in the bundled Core.
- **Model Roles window** now lists backend-filtered eligible models grouped by kind, split into chat and specialized sections, and hides roles the backend marks hidden.
- **Delegation chips**: models tagged with `^` in a message render as chips on your message in the transcript.
- **Chinese labels** for all Core settings and options newly added upstream (find, generation rate, stream, judgment, title spinner, spelling, and more).

### Changed

- The `/drop` session command is now `/delete` in the command menu (the `drop` alias still works).

### Fixed

- **Stats dashboard** no longer shows a dead-end "stats unavailable" error while the bundled stats server finishes its first-time re-index after an upgrade; it now stays in a loading state and recovers on its own.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 18.1.20** with the latest upstream provider, collaboration, speculative execution, and tool interaction updates.

### Fixed

- **Model switching**: slow switches have more time to finish, and connection failures display an error.
- **Quota display**: Kimi and other providers with unspecified quota units show the known usage percentage instead of an internal `unknown` label.
- **Math rendering**: TeX formulas render correctly in replies and restored history, stay together while streaming, and scroll within narrow windows.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **History restoration**: reloading a restored task shows its transcript even when task metadata arrives before the ready event.
- **Preference reliability**: slow startup reads cannot undo a chosen theme or font; failed proxy and launch-profile saves preserve edits and never trigger a premature restart.
- **Concurrent task updates**: completed subtasks and live goal state survive delayed refreshes, and retired tasks cannot send commands to their replacements.
- **Settings navigation**: search results for proxy and launch parameters open Advanced; concurrent workspace profile edits preserve each other.
- **Desktop navigation**: workspace links cannot replace the application with an untrusted document.
- **Rule editing**: empty Bash approval and interception rules use an object editor; terminal-only spelling controls are hidden and new Core settings have Chinese labels.

- **Task isolation**: delayed replies, queued input, modes and collaboration updates stay with the task that requested them.
- **Reliable input**: running tasks retain send and stop controls; uncertain delivery preserves the draft and prevents accidental duplicate submission.
- **Settings and dialogs**: eight searchable settings groups remain accessible at narrow widths, with consistent focus and truthful security states.
- **Session actions**: sharing previews match uploads; imports and handoff retries avoid duplicates; file changes distinguish repository state from edit history and virtual output.
- **Statistics**: request history supports stable pagination, and usage separates current context from the complete session journal.
- **Desktop boundaries**: typed sharing, voice and side questions retain their preview or start step; unavailable context limits show as unknown, and statistics connect only to the bundled service.
- **Startup and recovery**: delayed setup checks no longer cover an open dialog, and restarting the core preserves unsent drafts even when its session identity changes.
- **Notifications**: transient notifications stay clear of the composer's send and stop controls.

- **Formatted write previews**: overwrite diffs match the final file after automatic formatting.
- **Extension choices**: selection dialogs display option descriptions while returning the original choice to the agent.
- **Continuous conversation rendering**: replies, steering, and follow-ups keep their content and order when multiple lifecycle events arrive together.
- **Context maintenance**: automatic compaction refreshes history without clearing resumed work, and long context summaries open on demand.
- **Transcript continuity**: switching tasks restores the reading position and expanded process groups; earlier errors remain available in history.
- **Appearance controls**: GUI fonts scale transcript text consistently, density no longer zooms the page, and terminal palettes apply only when explicitly enabled without leaking across tasks.

### Changed

- **Redesigned GUI themes**: eleven coordinated palettes with clearer text, quieter surfaces, and matching transcript and terminal colors.

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 18.1.13**: includes Muse Code subscription support, memory scope isolation, corrected Astra context windows, and more reliable tool calls and retries.
- **Retry and shell settings**: GUI settings include waiting for quota resets and per-command approval of simple `&&` chains; long retry waits show a scheduled time and keep notifications brief.
- **GUI settings**: theme, density, and accessible colors use application preferences; terminal-only display options are hidden, and proxy and launch configuration live under Advanced.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Bash terminal images**: Kitty and Sixel graphics returned by the bundled agent render alongside command output, including multiple images.
- **Richer model and session details**: the model picker shows catalog names, descriptions, release badges, intelligence, and speed, while session info shows routed models and credit usage.

### Changed

- **Clone-first worktrees**: worktree tabs now honor omp's configured copy-on-write backend and fall back to a normal checkout when cloning is unavailable.
- **Current omp settings**: Settings includes Chinese labels for the new provider, reaction, skill, eval, image-question, and isolation controls.
- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 18.1.10**: packaged sidecars include current Codex V2 metadata and cache handling, disabled-reasoning preservation, Plan Review mouse input, and subagent yield updates from monorepo commit `36732cf5ed`.

### Fixed

- **Agent reactions**: opening reaction emoji render as a badge on the preceding user message instead of ordinary assistant prose.
- **Eval image output**: images returned by eval-backed browser, computer, JavaScript, and Python runs render alongside their text output.

### Removed

- **Obsolete vision controls**: removed the retired `/vision` menu and legacy `inspect_image` settings after omp moved image questions to `read <image>?q=<question>`.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **Sharpshooter memory controls**: Settings now exposes the model, consolidation interval, and context injection limit for project decision memory.

### Changed

- **Clearer session navigation**: workspace folders, chat icons, nested task alignment, and stronger active states make the sidebar hierarchy easier to scan.
- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 18.0.11**: packaged sidecars include the latest provider compatibility, model discovery, Anthropic context management, and z.ai OAuth fixes from monorepo commit `6655097656`.

### Fixed

- **Work conversation settlement**: streamed turns stay visible until the persisted transcript replaces them by entry ID, preventing replies from disappearing or rendering twice.
- **Immediate prompt feedback**: user prompts render locally before a slow RPC settles and hand off to the persisted transcript exactly once.
- **Workspace creation intent**: choosing a workspace from New task always opens an agent task instead of occasionally creating a chat.
- **Modal Escape handling**: Escape closes the topmost dialog after IME composition ends instead of being ignored by stale key-code state.
- **Theme overlays**: session theme accents are reapplied consistently after changing or restoring the global theme.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- **Two-session split view**: drag a tab onto the workspace or use its context menu to run two isolated sessions side by side or stacked, with a resizable, keyboard-accessible divider and restored layout.

### Changed

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 18.0.6**: packaged sidecars now include current provider, browser, task, streaming, TUI, and runtime fixes from monorepo commit `ef0bd7d84a`.

### Fixed

- **Completed-turn reconciliation**: a reply that finalizes while streaming now remains one conversation turn instead of appearing twice.
- **Provider configuration cancellation**: cancelling an edit exits the provider configuration flow instead of repeatedly reopening it.
- **Recovered conversation errors**: reactivating a conversation keeps partial output but removes stale interruption and network error boxes from older turns.
- **Todo transcript progress**: status updates replace the existing Todo history row instead of stacking one row per progress step.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Branch to a new tab**: user and assistant message footers can copy the conversation through that exact turn into an independent session and open it in the current window without changing the source session.
- **Plan save-only review**: plan approval suggests a topic filename, saves the reviewed Markdown, exits plan mode, and reports when a fresh session is cancelled or fails instead of claiming success.
- **Context cleanup and image publishing controls**: `/shake thinking` removes reasoning history, while Settings exposes usable nested JSON configuration for the complete image URL broker with masked credentials.
- **Native writing assistance**: the composer and expanded editor enable platform spelling, autocorrect, sentence capitalization, and native replacement suggestions.
- **Shared session pins**: pinning a GUI session keeps the bundled agent's pinned-session list in sync without losing concurrent updates from other windows or the CLI.
- **Model benchmark**: run the bundled omp TTFT, prefill, and decode benchmark from a native GUI results table.

### Changed

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 18.0.0**: packaged sidecars now include the current upstream runtime plus RPC plan-save, thinking-only context shake, entry-id branching, and race-safe shared session pins from monorepo commit `d9e6bdaa2d`.

### Fixed

- **Independent conversation navigation**: expanding task or agent docks no longer compresses the left-side turn navigator or extends it behind the composer.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- **Bundled agent upgraded**: packaged sidecars now carry omp 17.4.0 plus the marketplace RPC features from monorepo commit `a7b2784898` — plugin metadata/themes on the catalog, and post-mutation activation verdicts computed from the installed-plugin runtime snapshot.
- **Assisted updates for unsigned macOS builds**: ad-hoc-signed apps now download the architecture-matched DMG, show progress, verify its release-metadata SHA-512, open it in Finder, and explain the safe manual replacement flow. Certificate-signed builds retain Squirrel's restart-and-install path ([#3](https://github.com/nornzach/oh-my-pi-gui/issues/3)).

### Added

- **Plugin marketplace**: browse plugins with author/license/category/tags metadata and clickable repository/homepage links; installs ask for confirmation before granting local execution rights, and executable plugin changes restart their originating tab when idle (or after the running turn) before refreshing state.
- **Declarative plugin themes**: plugins can ship a `gui.theme` token map; tokens are validated against the transcript palette and layered over the active theme, with the agent theme winning conflicts.

### Fixed

- **Manual compaction RPC**: submitting `/compact` now uses the long-running compaction channel instead of falsely failing after the prompt RPC's 8-second timeout while compaction continues.
- **Cold-start theme flash**: a pre-paint script applies the saved color scheme before first render — dark-theme users no longer see a white flash on launch.
- **IME-safe abort**: Escape during CJK candidate composition dismisses the IME instead of aborting the running turn.
- **Session stats staleness**: switching sessions clears the previous session's token/cost readout immediately, and a late response from the old session can no longer repaint it.
- **External-link scheme guard**: links opening a new window only launch http(s) URLs, blocking arbitrary protocol handlers from renderer surfaces.
- **Sidebar performance**: collapsed workspace groups no longer build their session rows into the DOM on every background refresh.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 17.4.0**: packaged sidecars now include the latest upstream context-maintenance, provider, tool, and runtime fixes from monorepo commit `8a4f72647a`.
- **Context-maintenance parity**: settings now expose current compaction ordering, asynchronous compaction, extended-context, and eval background options, while transcript summaries show the selected method and before/after token counts.

### Fixed

- **Session and extension recovery**: aborting an active retry clears its pending UI and server retry state, and fire-and-forget extension UI updates no longer retain stale tab ownership.
- **macOS first-launch override**: release bundles are now completely ad-hoc signed, preserving Gatekeeper's user-override flow instead of being rejected as a corrupted bundle when no Developer ID certificate is available ([#2](https://github.com/nornzach/oh-my-pi-gui/pull/2) by [@Brandon168](https://github.com/Brandon168)).

## [0.8.3] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 17.3.8**: packaged sidecars now include Qwen reasoning-effort fallback handling, catalog routing fixes, compaction boundary hardening, MCP OAuth reauthentication discovery, model and provider refreshes, and updated usage aggregation from monorepo commit `943bb49462`.
- **Code / Work navigation**: the sidebar now switches between project-bound Code sessions and a full-agent Work lane backed by a GUI-managed default workspace; the main sidebar action creates an Agent, its adjacent quick-chat action creates a tool-free Chat, and saved Chats remain visible in their global sidebar section. Chat creation also remains available from the tab strip, shortcuts, command palette, and native menu.
- **Unified session search entry**: the sidebar header now opens the existing global session picker with metadata, fuzzy, project-path, recency, and full-transcript matching instead of maintaining a weaker duplicate inline filter.
- **In-app file preview**: local file links in rendered responses now open the Files drawer; Markdown renders as formatted content, while SQL and other text files use the code view with external-open and @mention actions retained.
- **Live session metrics**: the title bar now shows total tokens, cost, cache-hit rate, and actual execution time for the active session, while management actions move into the collapsible sidebar navigation.
- **Context usage meter**: the composer shows live used/available tokens and the popover adds an accessible progress bar plus explicit used and remaining totals.
- **Opt-in provider discovery**: new custom providers no longer fetch `/v1/models` automatically; model discovery is an explicit choice, preventing a single manually configured model from expanding into hundreds of upstream entries.
- **Simplified settings navigation**: removed the decorative workspace/logo header so settings navigation starts directly with its useful sections.

### Fixed

- **Wide click targets**: press feedback no longer scales full-row buttons away from the pointer, so execution summaries, task/agent disclosures, and other wide menu rows reliably receive their click at either edge.
- **Workspace dock disclosures**: task and multi-agent card headers now collapse from the full row or right chevron even after entering focused "view all" mode; the separate back action remains available for returning to the summary without collapsing.
- **Workspace drawer resizing**: the right-side divider now measures from the window edge instead of recursively shrinking against the drawer's own width, so dragging left grows it and dragging right reduces it without snapping closed.
- **Stable execution disclosures**: reasoning/tool summaries now stay exactly where the user leaves them across live status updates, virtualization, and live-to-final row replacement instead of auto-opening and auto-closing during a run.
- **Extension status output**: transient extension status pills no longer float over composer controls; extension widget text still uses the shared terminal-output renderer instead of exposing raw escape codes.
- **Model pricing input**: zero, leading-zero decimals, and arbitrary fractional prices such as `0.014` remain editable instead of being erased or rewritten mid-entry.
- **Transcript action placement**: user-message timestamps and copy actions render below the bubble instead of escaping into the right side of wide layouts.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 17.3.7**: packaged sidecars now include brokered extension file-write/delete fallbacks, restored configurable stats-dashboard binding, refreshed GPT context/pricing data, paid xAI/SuperGrok defaults for Grok 4.6, and the corrected xAI chat User-Agent from monorepo commit `e9e2fa8b10`.
- **Frame-paced streaming presentation**: live replies now coalesce IPC bursts onto browser frames, promote complete Markdown paragraphs/code/math into parse-once blocks, keep only the unfinished suffix lightweight, and reveal new text with a subtle fade plus a smooth breathing caret instead of 200ms chunk jumps. Agent-event delivery now runs at a stable ~30 Hz, while finalized content and manual scroll positions remain unchanged.
- **Responsive composer controls**: thinking level, fast mode, approval mode, and session modes now stay expanded across the toolbar whenever its measured width can hold them; only narrow composers fall back to the compact overflow menu, including live transitions when sidebars or the window resize.
- **Compact composer placement**: removed the redundant keyboard-shortcut caption below the composer and tightened its outer spacing so the input sits closer to the window footer.
- **Simplified window chrome**: removed the redundant bottom status strip and moved the keyboard-shortcuts entry into the top toolbar, giving the transcript and composer the full window height.

### Fixed

- **Tool-card path links**: clicking a path whose file no longer exists now surfaces an error toast instead of failing silently (`openPath`/reveal both no-op on missing paths).
- **Bash trailer stripping**: the wall-time notice is removed wherever it sits (the agent appends it before intermediate notices like timeout-clamp and pty fallback) instead of leaking into the output block when it is not the final line.
- **Escape-sequence gate**: output carrying only OSC escapes (window titles, hyperlinks) is parsed and stripped now too, instead of printing raw `\x1b]…` bytes.
- **Undefined theme tokens**: the conversation-navigator focus ring referenced `--omp-focus-ring` and the security finding detail referenced `--omp-shadow` — neither token exists; both now map to defined tokens (`--omp-accent`, `--omp-shadow-md`).
- **Sidebar interactions**: the dragged sidebar width persists across sessions; clicking elsewhere or pressing Escape cancels a pending inline delete confirm; Escape clears the search box; session status dots carry translated tooltips (previously raw English status strings).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- **Bundled agent upgraded to omp 17.3.5**: the packaged sidecars now use the native PDF backend, updated provider/model catalog, one-shot retry hardening, stale Agent Hub activity signals, and extension-handler timeout settings from monorepo commit `0107a9eb22`.
- **Native macOS menu-bar mark**: the generic colored status dot is replaced by a crisp Retina π template icon that automatically follows light, dark and selected menu-bar states.
- **Recent-first navigation**: sidebar sessions and workspace groups now move dynamically by last use, persist that MRU order across restarts and package updates, retain pinned-first priority, and preserve relevance ordering while searching.
- **Quieter execution history**: each reasoning/tool run now folds into one lightweight inline activity summary instead of a stack of nested cards and scroll boxes; active work opens for progress, then both successful and failed runs collapse to an outcome summary with full details available on demand.

### Fixed

- **OMP 17.3.5 GUI parity**: PDF page screenshots returned by the upgraded native `read` tool now render inline, stale Agent Hub registrations are labeled as having no active turn and remain cancellable, and the new extension-handler timeout setting is localized instead of silently degrading to raw schema text.
- **omp 17.3.5 sidecar builds**: the GUI packager now follows upstream's native PDF implementation and no longer calls the removed MuPDF generation/reset scripts, so upstream syncs can rebuild the bundled agent instead of failing before compilation.
- **Live provider catalog**: login, logout, and custom provider/model add, edit, or delete operations now invalidate and refresh every provider/model selector; slow discovery finishes update the GUI automatically, upstream failures are shown in Providers, explicit refresh bypasses the cache, settings dropdowns no longer retain process-lifetime option caches, and custom OpenAI or Anthropic Messages providers can populate models directly from `/v1/models` without a manual model row.
- **Clean, consistent tabs**: the disposable empty startup chat now disappears after a real tab opens (including layouts saved by older builds), while drafts and genuine sessions remain protected; restored tabs carry their transcript path before delayed session metadata arrives, so labels reliably use the same renamed-title/first-message fallback as the sidebar and truncate long text with the full title available on hover.
- **Persistent tab workspace**: the open top-tab order and active session now survive app restarts and package replacement; stale workspaces are discarded and missing transcripts fall back safely instead of reopening a random project.
- **Single waiting indicator**: model-response, retry, and compaction waiting rows now show one loading animation instead of duplicating it in the transcript timeline.
- **Single execution indicator**: each active turn or execution phase now owns at most one loading animation; timeline groups, expanded tools, read previews, todo rows, PR checks, the title bar, and the active tab use static status dots instead of stacking duplicate spinners and pulses.
- **Thinking level selection**: nested effort options now dispatch before the parent runtime-settings menu dismisses them, and explicit picker/cycle changes synchronize both the configured selector and effective effort from the authoritative RPC receipt instead of leaving stale state behind.
- **Fresh local packages**: every packaging command now rebuilds the Electron app first instead of silently reusing an old `out/` directory.
- **Default startup tab**: untargeted launches and new windows now open a fresh, unnamed global chat without inheriting a random recent workspace or auto-resuming its session; the chat's internal process cwd is no longer presented as a selected workspace.
- **Streaming transcript reading position**: any manual scroll-up releases tail following immediately; live-row growth no longer competes with native browser anchoring, and finalizing a streamed response preserves the virtual row identity instead of snapping an unpinned reader to the bottom.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Felt-quality visual language** (plan 22): one accent family — dark mode is the night version of the light theme instead of a separate cobalt-blue product; surfaces get a clear hierarchy (warm paper canvas, sidebar one step darker, user bubbles with a visible hairline border, code blocks that read as inset rather than page); card borders strengthened; hover/press states change only color and alpha with shared motion tokens (`--omp-motion-fast` / `--omp-motion-med`), now lint-enforced so layout never shifts on interaction.
- **Session switching feels like turning a page**: the outgoing transcript stays on screen until the new session's transcript is ready — no blank flash; sidecar events arriving mid-switch are dropped instead of appending onto the outgoing transcript; hydrated transcripts patch in place when delivery identities match, eliminating the second paint after tab restore.
- **Conversation navigator**: a stack of anchor buttons (timestamp + preview) along the transcript lets you jump between turns in long sessions; it compacts beyond 32 anchors and collapses into a dense rail beyond 64.
- **Execution groups**: completed reasoning/tool phases collapse to a single-line disclosure, while live and failed work auto-opens so current progress and actionable errors are never hidden.
- **Goal control strip**: a compact persistent bar in the dock carries the session's active goal and its controls.
- **Context usage popover**: the token/context readout moved out of the title bar and status footer into a popover anchored to the composer (accent-dot indicator on its button); the status footer's minimal mode is now path-only.
- **Markdown**: user-authored prompts no longer parse single-dollar inline math, so SQL/JSONPath expressions like `$.field` stay literal; display math (`$$…$$`) still renders.
- **Settings schema labels**: updated for omp 17.3.x — per-agent advisor (`task.agentAdvisor`) label added, stale `advisor.subagents` label removed.
- **Sidebar rows**: session and workspace titles no longer compress into scrolling labels on hover; full-row titles stay readable with overflow-aware action buttons.
- **Bundled agent**: the sidecar is rebuilt from the monorepo fork tracking upstream omp 17.3.3.

### Fixed

- Session-switch races: events could append onto the outgoing transcript while the new one hydrates, and tab restore could repaint the entire transcript a second time.
- Model thinking display: reasoning level and context usage no longer duplicate across the title bar, status footer, and composer surfaces.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- **Agent and chat navigation**: chat history now lives in a dedicated global section instead of appearing under workspace projects; workspace groups, counts, delete operations, and “new here” actions are agent-only, while saved chats preserve their chat kind when opened in a tab.
- **Large execution-dock summaries**: Todo and Agents share one scroll owner, summarize large collections into bounded previews, preserve actionable and urgent rows, and expand one card into a focused full-list view without squeezing the composer behind nested scrollbars.
- **Codex-style sidebar tasks**: workspace and session titles use the full row until hover compresses them into overflow-aware scrolling labels beside their action buttons, workspace rows reveal a one-click new-agent button on hover, session clicks open in tabs by default, and idle background tasks can be renamed or deleted while other tabs continue running.
- **Secondary text hierarchy**: session-list titles now use smaller, quieter typography, expanded reasoning content renders smaller, dimmer, and without bold emphasis, and the sidebar utility bar now aligns with the main status footer height.
- **Model token accounting**: the model stats table now shows exact uncached input, output, cache-read, and cache-write token counts plus cache hit rate for cost analysis.
- **English and Chinese GUI localization**: completed bilingual coverage for native menus, settings and dynamic schema options, onboarding, notifications, accessibility text, tool renderers, and shared application surfaces, with persisted language selection synchronized across renderer and main processes.

### Fixed

- **Fresh agent sessions**: new agent tabs now start with empty session state even when the project enables CLI auto-resume; replaced background sessions discard their old transcript, draft, title, approval, and extension UI snapshots; and old subagents no longer reappear after an in-place session reset.
- **Safe sidebar task actions**: saved chat sessions now open in chat tabs, and automatic compaction is treated as busy so affected tasks cannot be renamed or deleted mid-operation.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **Edit tool summaries**: freeform hashline and apply-patch invocations now derive edited paths from their payload headers, so collapsed transcript rows and streaming fallback headers no longer render without a target file.
- **Transcript timeline spacing**: timestamped phase markers now reserve enough row height and use a tighter marker-to-time stack, preventing adjacent completion and background-task markers from overlapping.
- **Transcript delivery identity**: `agent_end` payloads that contain post-maintenance rewrites of already streamed tool results are now deduplicated by stable delivery fields, preventing a full result and its `[Shaken]` replacement from rendering as separate conversation rows.
- **Conversation hierarchy**: composer mode controls now collapse into one stateful menu, prompt bubbles size to their content, queue management uses a wider layout with full-size controls, and repeated identical notices coalesce into a counted toast.
- **Provider credential editing**: provider-row edit actions now resolve the exact editable resource. Custom `models.yml` providers open their own configuration, while registered API-key providers such as Tavily and DeepSeek reopen their credential flow instead of opening an unrelated custom-provider form or exposing no edit action.
- **Todo transcript snapshots**: automatic cleanup after all todos complete now clears only the live state and preserves the final completed snapshot instead of appending a contradictory "Todos cleared" row.
- **Live todo transcript updates**: successful todo tool results now update the active todo state and append the transcript snapshot immediately, without waiting for the run to finish or the session to be reopened.
- **Editable, sortable pending messages**: the message-queue panel now edits plain steering and follow-up text in place, keeps reorder controls visible without hover, persists the visible order through the agent queue RPCs, and rolls back optimistic changes when RPC responses or transport calls fail.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- **Global surface unification**: content surfaces are now colorless by policy — cards, rows, chips, panels, and page sections render transparent over the canvas and separate with hairline borders, while paint is reserved for the canvas, navigation chrome, floating overlays (modals/menus/toasts), interaction states, semantic fills, code blocks, and form fields. The policy is written into `styles/global.css` and enforced by `scripts/lint-surfaces.mjs` (wired into `bun run check`), so static grey fills can no longer creep back in.
- **Unified content column**: the transcript, composer, dock, settings, and management pages now share one centered, viewport-adaptive container (`omp-column-reading` / `omp-column-workspace` in `styles/components.css`) with a fluid gutter — replacing the transcript's asymmetric left-rail gutters and the settings window's per-tab max-widths, so every page aligns the same way at every resolution.
- **Unified type scale**: UI text across chat, tools, panels, settings, dialogs, and layout now uses the six-step `text-omp-*` scale (defined in `global.css`, enforced by the surface lint) instead of ~990 ad-hoc raw pixel classes.
- **Live execution state moved into the conversation**: todos, plan review, subagents, and the message queue now render as collapsible live cards in a dock between the transcript and the composer instead of hiding behind the workspace drawer. Todo editing (status cycle, inline edit, drag reorder), plan review (steps/raw, approve, per-step feedback), the subagent roster (list/graph, expandable transcripts), and queue management (reorder/remove/clear in a modal from the dock chip) keep their full capabilities; queued messages continue to render as inline bubbles at the transcript tail. The workspace drawer now carries only Diff, Files, and Logs, and command-palette entries (`todo edit`, `plan-review`) deep-link the matching dock card.

### Added

- **Todo change archive in the transcript**: every semantic todo-list change after session hydration inserts a compact snapshot row at its position in the conversation (expandable, read-only), so the evolution of the work plan is reviewable alongside the messages that drove it.
- **Cross-lane queue moves**: queue entries can switch between the steering and follow-up lanes from the queue manager (appended to the target lane's end via the extended `queue_move` RPC).
- **Dock height budget**: the dock region caps at 45% of the window height with its own scroll, so simultaneous plan/todo/agents cards can't squeeze the transcript away.

### Fixed

- **Responsive conversation sizing**: the starter cards, transcript, composer, and title bar now shrink from the workspace's actual available width, switch to compact controls at constrained widths, and cannot expand the main canvas past the viewport or clip its right edge.

### Removed

- **Workspace drawer tabs**: Todo, Plan, Agents, and Queue tabs (and the composer activity strip) are gone; their surfaces live in the center dock. Existing `defaultPanelTab` preferences pointing at removed tabs fall back to Diff.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Native management surfaces**: Settings now exposes dedicated Skills, MCP, Security Center, SSH Hosts, and Updates pages backed by native RPC instead of hiding these workflows behind commands.
- **Skills and operations controls**: inspect installed skills, enable or disable them by scope, preview their full instructions, audit the active repository, and manage reusable SSH targets from the GUI.

### Changed

- **Responsive application shell**: settings pages, center content, dialogs, drawers, tabs, and activity panels now size from the available viewport instead of fixed desktop measurements; wide displays use the space without stretching content into unreadable lines, while compact windows reflow controls and columns.
- **Quieter visual hierarchy**: management pages use the window surface as their canvas, reserve tint for selection and status, remove nested grey/green panel fills, reduce decorative borders, and let long previews grow with the page instead of clipping them into a short inset box.
- **Settings information architecture**: OMP capabilities, extensions, operations, configuration, and application concerns are separated into discoverable left-navigation groups with localized labels and search support.

### Fixed

- **Auto-update release discovery**: update errors are normalized into actionable UI state, and the release pipeline now publishes `latest-mac.yml`, ZIP payloads, and blockmaps alongside both DMGs so packaged clients can actually resolve and download the newest version.
- **Dialog and drawer containment**: stacked overlays share a single top-layer contract, preserve focus ownership, fit narrow windows, and keep every tab and footer action reachable without overflowing the viewport.
- **Skills, MCP, and inventory layouts**: removed fixed preview heights and oversized tinted containers that left most of the window empty or made content look disabled; empty, loading, error, and populated states now share the same responsive geometry.
- **Renderer presentation regressions**: compacted message/tool rows no longer reserve blank bands, and status, badges, cards, and navigation keep consistent contrast without unexplained dark or colored backgrounds.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Six designed light themes**: Porcelain, Linen, Sage Paper, Sakura Mist, Glacier, and Sandstone add distinct low-glare palettes while preserving the complete GUI token contract.
- **Markdown image rendering**: assistant output can display remote, data/blob, and local image sources; local files are read through the bounded preload bridge and failures degrade to an explicit fallback instead of an empty block.

### Changed

- **Subagent workspace views**: the Agents drawer now presents a real parent/child spawn tree plus a graph view, uses the sidecar's concise UI label instead of dumping the full delegated prompt into the heading, keeps completed rows legible, exposes expandable transcripts, and derives elapsed time from the agent's own runtime sample so opening the drawer never restarts the clock.
- **Lower-churn streaming renderer**: text/thinking updates are throttled at the presentation edge, hidden or empty rows stay out of the virtual layout, and the transcript follows appended content only while the reader remains near the end.

### Fixed

- **Active-tab routing and hydration races**: tab status, session hydration, queue/subagent state, approvals, extension UI, composer drafts, and streaming snapshots are now applied only to the tab and session that own them. Fresh tabs can become usable even when their ready event beats the full route wiring, and rapid switches discard stale hydration replies.
- **Long-transcript session switching**: switching to a session anchors the transcript at its real end instead of an arbitrary virtualized position, while intentional user scrolling is preserved during subsequent streaming.
- **Composer dispatch isolation**: delayed submits, queued shorthand, paste blobs, and restored failures keep their originating tab/session identity and cannot leak into a tab selected after Enter.
- **Chat-tab workspace safety**: agent-only drawer tabs and modes are clamped out of tool-free chat sessions instead of showing stale data from the previous agent tab.
- **Unknown subagent statuses**: future or provider-specific status strings now degrade to a muted label instead of dereferencing missing metadata and crashing the renderer.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- **Tab × worktree binding (plan/20)**: any tab can run in its own git worktree — parallel tabs never step on each other's files. Create via the tab strip's third button (⌥T) or a workspace group's menu: names a branch `omp/gui/<name>` checked out at `~/.omp/wt/gui-<name>-<hash7>` (swept by `omp worktree clear`). Bound tabs carry a branch marker, label by worktree name, and — on close — prompt to delete a clean worktree or force-delete/keep a dirty one (per-tab status reads ride a new tab-addressed RPC channel, never forcing a switch).
- **Git status segment in the footer**: branch plus `*unstaged`/`+staged`/`?untracked` indicators (TUI parity), live-polled from the active session and refreshed on run end / tab / cwd change; click to refresh.
- **PR Center (plan/21, ⌥P)**: a fullscreen panel for GitHub pull requests — rich list (CI health badges, author initial avatars, diff stats), markdown detail with per-check status, per-file lazily-loaded syntax-highlighted diffs, an AI-drafted create flow (title/body from the branch's commits, editable before submit), and one-click checkout that opens the PR in its own worktree-bound tab.
- **Upstream v17.2.10+ sync (112 commits)**: Chinese quota-exhaustion classification, ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL for chat, OAuth org re-login fix, concurrent extension imports, ACP legacy session resolution, hook-refusal and fallback-commit exit-code fixes, and more — all inherited via the bundled sidecar.

### Changed

- **Editorial execution timeline**: rebuilt the conversation renderer around narrated phases, stable virtual-row identities, compact status markers, quieter read/tool cards, refined typography, spacing, borders, light/dark colors, and clearer collapsed reasoning controls. Consecutive filler-only tool messages now merge into the surrounding phase instead of producing repetitive visual blocks.

### Fixed

- **White screen after replacing a running app**: packaged windows now fingerprint `app.asar` at launch and relaunch Electron when an installed update replaces those resources, preventing Chromium from mixing an old archive index with new bytes. The condition is recorded in the bounded runtime JSONL log with its trigger and resource identity.
- **Blank transcript bands and unstable streaming rows**: hidden tool results, punctuation-only deltas, and other zero-height messages no longer reserve virtualized space; tool-only live turns still appear immediately, and existing rows keep stable keys when history changes.
- **New-session and workspace menus**: outside dismissal now begins on the next pointer press, after the opening click has completed, so the sidebar `+` menu and workspace actions stay open and remain clickable.
- **Stacked dialog focus and Escape handling**: opening a dialog moves focus inside it, closing restores the trigger, and only the visually topmost modal/settings layer handles Escape or focus trapping.
- **Tab chip tracks the session's workspace**: switching a session re-roots the chip's cwd (previously frozen at the app's launch project for the tab's whole life).
- **Idle-tab close bypass**: clicking × on an idle tab skipped the confirm handler entirely — it now routes through it, so the worktree cleanup prompt can't be missed.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Persistent runtime diagnostics**: React render failures, global JavaScript errors, unhandled promises, preload failures, failed page loads, renderer console errors, unresponsive windows, and renderer/GPU/utility process exits are now recorded as bounded, rotating JSONL at `~/Library/Application Support/@oh-my-pi/omp-gui/logs/gui-runtime.jsonl`. A root-level error surface shows the failure and log path instead of leaving an unexplained blank window.

### Fixed

- **White-screen recovery after renderer exit**: when Chromium's renderer process disappears while the Electron main process and sidecars remain alive, the window now records the exit reason/code and reloads the renderer automatically. Recovery is rate-limited to prevent a boot crash from becoming an infinite reload loop.
- **Packaged font loading**: the renderer CSP now permits bundled data fonts, removing a noisy startup error that could rapidly fill the new runtime log.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Chat sessions — tool-free conversations**: new session type (`kind: "chat"` in session headers) for pure dialogue without tool access. Chat sessions isolate from agent sessions in the sidebar and switch dialogs, spawn with `--chat` flag, and render a trimmed composer (no slash commands, file refs, or queue syntax). New-tab menu offers Agent (workspace chooser) or Chat (direct tab) modes.
- **Workspace group management**: right-click any workspace header to pin/unpin (pinned groups float to top in pin order), rename (inline edit with check/cancel), or delete (with confirmation and session-file cleanup). Workspace aliases persist across restarts via `sidebar-prefs` store.
- **Session tabs — full parallel system**: tabs own independent sidecar processes with complete state isolation (session, run, queue, subagents). Background tabs execute autonomously with streaming dots and done badges; switching snapshots and restores full UI state. Type-isolated switching refuses cross-kind attaches (agent ↔ chat) and routes to a new tab of the correct type instead.
- **Session kind guards**: SessionIndex exposes `kindFor(path)` to distinguish agent/chat sessions; switch/open flows check kind compatibility and refuse or redirect mismatches (e.g., clicking a chat session while an agent tab is active opens a new chat tab instead of breaking the current run).

### Fixed

- **ContextMenu click-through race**: menu items now fire their `onSelect` handlers reliably — the dismiss listener switched from `pointerdown` to `click` so it no longer races menu item interactions and closes the portal before the action executes.
- **Session list churn**: SessionIndex watcher events debounce to 350ms trailing (one refresh max per burst) and swap silently — no loading spinner on background updates, no animation churn while agents stream session files.
- **Sidebar ghosting during reorder**: removed all View Transitions CSS rules; pin/rename/delete operations now update immediately without snapshot overlays or crossfade artifacts.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **Session-tabs hardening pass** (full architecture audit + click-through repro): session-file ownership is now tracked pool-wide and duplicate attaches are refused/redirected on every open path — spawn-tab, sidebar/session-picker switch, session-tree "switch to this point", and "open in new window" (a foreign owner's window is focused instead) — closing the double-attach that silently forked transcripts when two sidecars shared one session file. Extension-UI/approval and host tool/URI responses now route to the sidecar that RAISED the request (never the currently-active tab), so answering an approval while viewing another tab can no longer approve the wrong session. Resuming a session into a new tab skips the redundant `switch_session` when the sidecar already holds it, removing an unconditional-abort hazard for the first typed message. Closing a tab whose sidecar is mid-run now inline-confirms (✓/✕, 3s auto-cancel) instead of silently killing the work; `retryPending` clears on tab switch; a failed `SET_ACTIVE_TAB` surfaces an error toast and re-converges from `GET_TABS`; hydrate clears the zombie streaming bubble when returning to a background-settled tab and re-asserts the subagent subscription; tab chips label by session title with an `#n` suffix for untitled duplicates.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **Session tabs — multi-session parallelism inside ONE window**: each tab owns its own sidecar process (independent session, run, queue, and subagents), so a running task no longer forces a new window — press `+` in the new tab strip (below the title bar) to start a parallel session next to the current one, exactly the Claude Code / Codex model. Background tabs keep executing autonomously (a tab's streaming dot shows activity; a done badge appears when its run finishes while you're elsewhere); switching tabs snapshots and restores the full session state (transcript, todos, subagents, queue lanes, model state, composer draft) and reattaches the renderer to that tab's sidecar with zero duplicated event listeners. Tabs close individually (releasing their sidecar; pool cap of 10 is now shared across tabs and windows), the busy-session switch dialog now offers "open in a new tab" as the recommended parallel path, and sessions can be opened straight into a new tab.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **Auto-update flow**: the app now discovers, stages, and applies updates from GitHub Releases end to end. A banner announces new versions ("新版本 x.y.z 已发布") with per-version dismissal; downloads run user-initiated (`autoDownload` stays off) with a live progress bar (percent + transferred/total, differential via release blockmaps); a "重启安装" prompt applies the staged update via quit-and-install. Settings → 界面 gains an 应用更新 row (current version + manual check + live status). The main-process updater drives a single status machine (idle/checking/available/downloading/downloaded/not-available/error) replayed to every window; `OMP_DEV_UPDATE_CHECK=1` + `dev-app-update.yml` enables the same flow from `electron-vite preview` for development.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **Activity Dock — execution state is now visible**. A persistent ActivityStrip above the composer shows `➤ 队列 N · 引导 M` while messages are queued and `🤖 N 个子代理 ▾` while subagents run, each jumping to its drawer tab; queued messages also render as grey pending bubbles at the stream tail with one-click removal. A new **队列** drawer tab (riding the new `get_queue`/`queue_remove`/`queue_move`/`queue_clear` RPCs with stable per-lane queue ids) manages both lanes: dnd-kit reorder plus hover-revealed ▲/▼ move buttons and per-item × delete, per-lane clear, count badges. Queue state is pushed live over a new `queue_update` frame emitted on every queue mutation (enqueue/drain/remove/move/clear), so the strip, panel, and bubbles track drains instantly instead of going stale until the next prompt. Composer mode chips are now stateful (accent + check + live tooltips: plan state, goal objective, loop limit) and the footer gains active-mode badges (计划/目标/循环/vibe/暂停). The agents tab's instance cards are labeled by task/assignment instead of bare type names, with status badges, elapsed time, model, and view-messages/abort/revive actions.
- **Realtime voice, collaboration, and debugger windows** complete the last three previously TUI-only interactive surfaces. Voice mode now starts the sidecar's native live controller, streams phase/transcript/audio-level updates, supports mute, and tears down on close; collaboration can host or join editable/read-only relay sessions, display/copy/open share links and live participants, leave cleanly, and expose `/collab`/`join`/`leave`; the debugger console sends the complete DAP action schema through the agent's existing debug tool and renders structured results.
- **Native `/btw`, `/tan`, `/omfg`, and agent pause flows**: ephemeral side questions stream outside the transcript and can be copied or promoted into a branch, tangential work dispatches through the background-agent controller, repeated-behavior complaints run the interactive TTSR rule forge, and pause/resume uses a process-wide gate shared by the main turn and subagents.

- **Queue shorthand in the composer** (TUI `queue-input.ts` parity): drafts starting with `->` or `=>` show a "➤ Queue" chip, enumerated lists (`1.` / `i.` / `a.` sequences with uniform indent and punctuation) preview a "splits into N" badge, and submitting dispatches one queued message per item — first item prompts with `streamingBehavior:"followUp"` when idle, the rest follow up, images ride on the first item only. Bare `->` with no images warns instead of enqueueing; partial dispatch failures restore the remainder as a renumbered queue draft. The composer auto-inserts a newline after a bare prefix, and items that name extension commands route through `prompt` (the `followUp` path would reject them server-side).
- **Backward model cycling (⇧⌃P)** now truly cycles backward via the new `cycle_model.direction` RPC arg (previously it rode the forward cycle as a wire gap).
- **Retry last failed turn (⌥R / palette "Retry Last Turn")** now uses the new `retry` RPC — the server knows what "failed turn" means — replacing the client-side re-send, which remains available as the distinct palette action "Resend Last Message".
- **Native `/clear`**: typed `/clear` and the palette "Clear Context" action now drop the conversation context in place via the new `clear_context` RPC (keeping the session id), with the dropped-message count toasted and the transcript/context bar rehydrated. Previously `/clear` was an alias for starting a new session, and a typed `/clear` could fall through to the model as literal text while idle.
- **Per-agent abort and revive** in the Agent Hub (TUI hub `x`/`r` parity): live rows get an inline-confirmed abort, parked rows get a revive, both riding the new `abort_subagent`/`revive_subagent` RPCs with translated refusal reasons (advisor read-only, main agent, not found, not parked).
- **Paste "Save as file"**: the large-paste card's third action now persists the blob into the session's `local://` store via the new `write_local_paste` RPC (agent-side name allocation, multi-window safe) and inserts the `local://paste-N.md` reference for the agent to read on demand. Falls back to the inline marker on write failure.
- **Large-paste handling** (TUI editor parity): pasted text over 10 lines or 1000 chars collapses to a `[Paste #N]` marker with the blob held in memory and expanded inline at submit time on every dispatch path (prompt, bash, python, queue items). Past `paste.largeMenuThreshold` lines (default 100) an inline card offers "paste inline" or "attach as wrapped block" (`<attachment>`) with a head/tail preview; Esc takes the default.
- **Keyboard shortcut top-up**: ⌃T toggles thinking-block visibility (via `hideThinkingBlock`), ⌃Enter sends as follow-up, ⌥M opens the model picker, ⌥A opens the agent hub, and ⌘/ opens a new searchable keyboard-shortcuts panel — which is also the new native home of `/hotkeys` in the command palette (previously TUI-only).
- **Usage row segments**: TTFT (when the message carries it) and an HH:MM message time now render alongside tokens/cost/duration/throughput, honoring `display.showTokenUsage`.
- GFM task-list checkboxes now render in markdown (readonly), closing the sanitize gap that stripped `<input>` tags.
- **Session tree node actions**: every node now offers three actions via its corner menu — "Switch to this point" (`switch_leaf` RPC, TUI tree-selector Enter parity, works on any node and restores the target's draft into the composer), "Branch from here" (user nodes), and "Open in new window" (`fork_from` RPC: an independent session file containing only the path to that node, opened in a parallel window). Keyboard Enter switches (Shift+Enter summarizes the abandoned branch first).
- **Foreign session import** (⌘K → "Import External Session"): a wizard lists Claude/Codex sessions (titles, workspaces, times, message counts), multi-selects, and imports each as a fresh OMP copy via the new `list_foreign_sessions`/`import_foreign_session` RPCs — a single import opens it immediately. Sources are never modified; unavailable sources are greyed with the reason.
- **Composer completion chain**: the autocomplete menu is now a provider chain (TUI `getSuggestions` order) adding slash-command argument completion (static subcommands + usage hints, dynamic MCP-server-name/directory candidates via `get_command_arg_completions`), GitHub `#123` → `pr://`/`issue://` completion, and emoji completion (`:smi` popup from a lazily loaded shortcode table, `:name:` inline replace on the closing colon, western emoticons on a terminator, submit-time expansion of stragglers — all gated by `emojiAutocomplete`). Commands with `allowArgs: false` close the menu after the name, and a contextual usage hint row shows the command's/subcommand's usage while you type.
- **Ctrl+G editor dialog**: a fullscreen CodeMirror editor (markdown, history, soft wrap) for the draft — ⌘↵/Save writes back (expanded paste markers resolve to inline text and their blobs are consumed), Esc with unsaved changes arms a double-Esc discard guard, and an optional button round-trips the content through `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` via a main-process temp-file bridge.
- **Read-tool grouping** (TUI read-tool-group parity): consecutive collapsible reads fold into one card (`Read (N)` with a `├─/└─` tree, same-file selector merges like `path:1-5,7`, single reads render `● Read <path:sel>`), accreting across assistant messages until visible text/thinking, a non-read tool, or a user message breaks the run. Applies to both finalized history and the live streaming path in full-detail mode (compact mode's ProcessGroup still wins); expanding reveals the individual read cards with full content.
- **MCP server management** (Extensions panel): an add-server wizard (stdio/http/sse transports, per-transport fields with validation parity — names may contain `:`, optional pre-flight connection test) plus upgraded server cards (scope/transport/auth-state badges, command or URL, tool count, expandable last error) with per-card 测试连接 and 重新授权 actions riding the new `mcp_add`/`mcp_test`/`mcp_reauth` RPCs. Connection tests use a throwaway manager and never disturb the live set; reauth drives the existing browser/code dialogs and rejects concurrent flows with `oauth_busy`.
- **Marketplace management** (Inventory panel): add marketplaces by source (https/git/ssh/`owner/repo`/local path — bare names rejected client-side), refresh with cache-freshness notes, remove behind inline confirm, and install/upgrade/uninstall plugins from an expandable per-marketplace list — all via the new `marketplace_action` RPC with in-flight states and copyable failure detail.
- **Plugin config editor** (Inventory panel): plugin rows open a detail drawer with enable toggle, feature checkboxes, and a schema-driven settings form (enum/chip/KV editors, validated JSON fallback). Server validation errors render under the field without losing your input; secret values are write-only (never echoed); per-field reset restores defaults.
- **Keybinding remapping**: the shortcuts panel (⌘/) is now editable — click any remappable row and press a new chord, with user-user conflict errors and shadow-vs-default warnings, per-row reset and reset-all. Overrides are GUI-local prefs (never `keybindings.yml`), take effect immediately, and survive restarts. Chords require a real modifier so typing is never hijacked.
- **Launch profiles** (Settings → 启动配置): per-workspace sidecar launch flags — system prompt / append prompt, extra directories (native picker), tool whitelist, no-rules / no-LSP / plan-yolo, profile, session dir, config overlay — with a truthful effective-command-line preview and a busy-aware "restart now" action. A 12-flag denylist guarantees code-controlled flags (`--session`, `--mode`, …) can never be smuggled in.
- **Markdown code line numbers**: an optional gutter for code blocks in assistant messages (Settings → GUI), sharing the tool renderers' gutter component.

### Changed

- **Prompt-passthrough commands are now native GUI flows**: the last batch of palette entries that injected `/cmd` text and rendered TUI-style text replies has been replaced with real affordances — Workspace Directories dialog (list/add via native picker/remove/move-session, riding new `get_directories`/`add_directory`/`remove_directory`/`move_session` RPCs), Context Report dialog (per-category token bars, `get_context_report`), Active Tools dialog (grouped searchable list, `get_active_tools`), Share Session dialog (encrypted link with copy/open, `share_session`), Background Jobs dialog (`get_jobs`), Force Tool picker (`set_force_tool`/`get_force_tool`), and a bundled Changelog dialog. One-shot actions (`/prewalk`, `/fresh`, `/shake elide|images`, `/reload-plugins`) run new RPCs with toasts; `/dump` formats the transcript client-side into the clipboard; `/queue` prefills the composer's `->` shorthand; advisor/computer/vision/browser/todo submenus map to their real toggles/panels; mcp enable/disable/remove/reconnect and marketplace/plugin install actions ride the existing `mcp_action`/`marketplace_action` RPCs with refreshes. Remaining prompts are intentional: skill/custom/MCP-prompt text expansions, security subsystem (own panel round), `/session pin/delete`, and text-report leftovers (advisor status/dump, mcp resources/prompts) pending structured RPCs. `ssh list/add/remove` is honestly `unavailable` until an SSH surface exists.
- The debug console is now a structured debugger UI instead of a raw-JSON REPL: a sessions strip (auto-refreshed, selectable, status badges, guided empty state with launch/attach examples), an action bar (Threads/Stack/Continue/Pause/Step Over/In/Out/Output/Terminate with state-aware enablement), and typed result rendering (thread tables, numbered stack frames, session snapshot cards, output scrollback). The raw JSON request editor survives behind a collapsed "Advanced" disclosure.
- The command palette is fully localized: all 159 built-in commands and submenu items resolve labels/descriptions through the locale (zh + en) at menu-construction time and rebuild on locale switch, and category headers render via the existing `category.*` keys.

### Fixed

- **MCP servers, shell-exported API keys, and CLI tools configured by bare name now work in the packaged app**: the sidecar spawn merges the user's login-shell environment (dumped once via `$SHELL -ilc env` with marker-delimited extraction — rc-exported provider keys like `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, locale, and tool config fill gaps the launch env lacks, while PATH merges the probed shell PATH with existence-checked well-known bin dirs as fallback). Finder-launched apps previously inherited launchd's bare env, so `mcp:codegraph`-style servers died with ENOENT and rc-only API keys showed providers as unauthenticated while the terminal TUI worked. Proxy vars keep the v0.3.1 precedence chain, and an explicitly exported launch env always wins. The external-editor round trip resolves `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` through the same probe and spawns with the merged PATH.
- **Auto-update and Help → Documentation now point at the GUI repo** (`nornzach/oh-my-pi-gui`) instead of the upstream CLI repo — update checks previously 404'd against `can1357/oh-my-pi` releases, and a future upstream macOS artifact could have offered a cross-product "update".
- The title bar no longer shows "新建会话" (or blank) for sessions whose auto-title never ran: empty-string title slots now fall through to the session-list title / first message at every layer (RPC state hydration, session switch, main-process session index).
- The `->` queue shorthand now works while streaming: the prefix parse runs before the streaming→steer fallback, so queued drafts enqueue as followUps with the prefix stripped instead of landing in the steer lane as literal `> text`.
- The bundled GUI sidecar build now generates and embeds the stats dashboard and MuPDF assets (alongside native and collaboration assets) before compilation, then restores every temporary source artifact. `omp --smoke-test` now passes on the shipped self-contained binary instead of the stats route failing with HTTP 500.
- The `prompt` RPC call now passes `streamingBehavior` through the preload bridge (the field existed on the wire but was dropped), which queue shorthand dispatch depends on for first-item semantics.
- Fixed a white-screen renderer crash on any session containing a read group: the group card's status selector allocated a new Map inside the zustand selector, so the snapshot was never referentially stable and React threw error #185 in a forceStoreRerender loop. Statuses now derive via useMemo from the stable store map reference.
- Thinking blocks now render reasoning as Markdown — bold headers, inline code, links, and fenced code blocks (TUI parity) — instead of showing literal `**` markers in monospace plain text. The live streaming caret behavior is unchanged, and the markdown pipeline is still sanitized for untrusted model output.

### Security

- Task-list checkbox rendering is two-layer hardened against untrusted model output: the sanitize schema value-pins `input` to `type="checkbox"` (raw `<input type="password">` / `type="file"` / `type="text"` in model output lose the attribute) and the component forces `disabled readOnly tabindex=-1` regardless of input attributes.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **Proxy support for the agent sidecar.** Provider requests (OAuth, streaming, usage) no longer depend on shell env the Finder-launched app never had: the sidecar now spawns with proxy env resolved per spawn — explicit GUI pref (Settings → GUI → HTTP proxy) → inherited env (terminal launch) → macOS system proxy (auto-detected via Chromium's PAC resolution). Applies on agent restart, done automatically when idle; a busy run is never killed to change proxy. This fixes codex/OAuth models hanging silently on proxy-only networks, where the TUI worked only because the terminal shell exported HTTPS_PROXY.
- Switching sessions while the attached session is streaming or compacting now opens a confirmation dialog offering "open in a new window" (the parallel path, recommended), "abort & switch", or cancel — instead of silently killing the in-flight run. Covers the sidebar, ⌘P session picker, and `omp://session/<id>` deep links; idle sessions still switch straight through.
- The model picker now flags over-context models (live session tokens exceed the model's context window) with a warning badge and tooltip, mirroring the TUI's grayed rows; picking one compacts with the current model first, then switches, with toasts at each stage.
- Failed turns now raise an in-app error toast in addition to the chat error bubble — desktop error notifications default off, so a provider failure (e.g. right after a model switch) no longer looks like a silent no-op. Deferred mid-run settles, live auto-retries, and user aborts stay quiet.
- The waiting-for-model row gains a second escalation tier: after 90s without a first response it explains the likely network cause, the ~5-minute automatic timeout/retry, and that Esc aborts immediately (previously only a generic 30s "slow response" hint).

### Changed

- The schema-driven Settings window now omits entries marked TUI-only from tabs, empty groups, Advanced, and global search instead of showing controls that cannot affect the GUI. Shared settings with real GUI behavior remain visible and now describe both clients honestly (themes, color-blind palette, status footer, native progress, title state, compact density, Mermaid, token usage, and compaction display).
- Settings now opens on an action-oriented **OMP Capabilities** home instead of generic runtime toggles, surfacing TTSR mid-stream correction, parallel subagents, role-based model routing, the second-model advisor, goal/loop modes, cross-session memory, and the native toolchain with direct configure/open actions; ordinary runtime controls remain available in the next tab.

### Fixed

- `/compact` (and the Command Palette "Compact Context" action) now shows success/failure feedback and refreshes the transcript and context-usage bar on completion — previously it resolved silently with no UI update.
- Boolean settings now use the full row as one switch, keep save-state text out of the hit target, immediately reflect the persisted value, and rehydrate after a sidecar reconnect instead of looking unclickable or reverting on restart.
- Capability-home toggles now expose their real runtime state: TTSR restarts the idle sidecar and resumes the current session so cached rule buckets actually change, busy sessions get an explicit next-restart notice, toggle buttons show in-flight state, and enabling Advisor without a resolvable advisor model now shows a persistent not-running badge plus the missing model-role warning instead of appearing to succeed silently.
- Slash commands **typed into the composer** ("/compact", "/model", …) no longer vanish without feedback: they always route through the prompt RPC (never steer/followUp while streaming, which would inject the text as a user steer), and local-only resolutions (`agentInvoked:false`, no agent events) now rehydrate the transcript — so the compaction summary, model change, and context bar actually appear, matching the TUI re-render.
- Session-replacing actions are now guarded everywhere while a turn is running, closing the paths that silently killed the run: the sidebar "+" workspace dialog (new session here / jump workspace / open project), the `/new` and `/clear` command-palette entries, and `/new` or `/clear` typed into the composer. All block with a warning toast (Esc to abort first, or use ⌘⇧N for a parallel window), consistent with the existing menu and deep-link guards; session switching itself already offered the new-window/abort/cancel dialog.
- Fixed a crash in language detection when `navigator.language` is unavailable (e.g. under the test runner), which took down the entire renderer test suite (52 failures).
- Fixed transcript noise in tool-heavy runs: punctuation-only text blocks (".", "…", "---" — model filler between tool calls) no longer render as stray glyphs and ghost bubbles, and tool-call-only messages drop the hover footer row and use compact padding, removing the ~60px-per-message blank bands between consecutive tool cards.
- Fixed the awaiting-model test harness missing `sessions.consumePendingOpen`, matching the boot contract added with parallel sessions.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Added true parallel sessions: up to 10 windows, each with its own independent agent sidecar process. Opening a session "in a new window" (per-session row button, ⌘⇧N / File → New Window, tray, deep link) spawns a dedicated sidecar for that window, so a session running in one window is never disturbed by switching or creating sessions in another. The sidecar manager is now a per-window pool (cap 10) instead of a global singleton; all IPC routes by `event.sender` to the calling window's sidecar, and each sidecar's events forward only to its owning window. Desktop notifications dedupe within a window but no longer collapse distinct windows' notifications, and the tray/dock indicator aggregates across windows (any error > streaming > waiting > idle).
- Added a per-row "open in new window" action in the session sidebar for explicit parallelism; the default click/`+` behavior (replace the current window's session, server aborts first) is unchanged.

### Changed

- Reworked session/workspace deletion to inline confirm: the first click swaps the trash button for an in-place ✓/✕ pair (confirm sits exactly where delete was), a second click deletes, ✕ or clicking away cancels — no more modal dialog in the center of the screen. Applies to both single sessions and whole workspace groups.
- Rebalanced sidebar visual hierarchy: session titles are now larger and bolder while workspace group headers are smaller and muted, so the session (the thing you act on) reads as the primary row and the workspace as a quiet grouping label.
- Made the left session sidebar resizable by dragging its right edge (mirrors the existing right-panel drag), clamped to 180–420 px.
- The rename (pencil) button on the active session row is now always visible instead of hover-only, so it can no longer be squeezed out of view by neighboring content.
- Upgraded `bun scripts/gen-types.ts` from a command-name-only comparison to a structural shape check: it now parses every `Rpc*` interface in the agent's `rpc-types.ts` and fails (`--check`) when the GUI's same-named interface drifts in field names. The host-tool, subagent, and `toolcall_delta` drifts below all slipped through the old name-only check.

### Fixed

- Fixed the Handoff, plan-approval, and session-tree label dialogs losing focus on every keystroke. The Modal component re-ran its focus-capture effect whenever the caller's `onClose` closure identity changed (on each `setState`), yanking focus from the input back to the dialog's close button; focus capture now runs once per open transition, and close-time focus restore no longer blurs an element inside a freshly opened dialog.
- Fixed the chat not following long streaming replies: the pinned-to-bottom effect only re-ran on row-count changes, so text accumulating inside the constant streaming row and the final message swap never scrolled. It now also tracks streaming text/thinking length so content growth snaps back to the bottom.
- Fixed the agent's `ask` tool (askDialog) leaving no waiting signal: `BLOCKING_UI_METHODS` omitted `askDialog`, so the title marker, sidebar signal light, tray waiting state, and unfocused-window notification all stayed off while the agent waited for an answer.
- Fixed spurious "RPC timeout" errors on long-running `!cmd` bash, `$ code` python, `/compact`, and HTML export. The sidecar only answers these after the work finishes, but every command shared an 8s timeout, so anything longer errored out while actually running; these commands now get generous windows and `window.omp.rpc.command` accepts a per-call timeout.
- Fixed streaming tool cards never showing their accumulating arguments: the `toolcall_delta` wire shape had drifted (`{contentIndex, delta, partial}` vs the assumed `{toolCallId, name, argsDelta}`), so the attribution id was always undefined and every delta overwrote one undefined-key phantom entry. Tool-call deltas are now attributed by the real id from `partial.content[contentIndex]`.
- Fixed live subagent updates attributing to the wrong (or a single undefined-key) entry: `subagent_lifecycle`/`progress`/`event` frames arrive nested as `{type, payload}`, but the GUI read flat fields off the top level, so `id`/`index` were always undefined. Lifecycle frames are now read from `payload`, and progress frames attribute by `payload.progress.id` (the batch-local `index` repeats across task batches).
- Fixed opening a session in a new window showing a blank conversation instead of the target session: the sidecar switch raced the window's boot hydration. The switch now happens in the new window's renderer on boot (it pulls a `pendingSessionPath` and runs `switch_session` + hydrate itself), which both orders the hydration correctly and surfaces switch failures in that window.
- Removed the `gui_open_url`/`gui_notify`/`gui_clipboard_read` host-tool registrations. They were deadlocked end-to-end: the agent emits `{id, toolName, arguments}` frames, the main-process executor read the drifted `{callId, name, args}` fields (always undefined), the renderer had zero `onHostToolCall` consumers, and the agent-side call has no timeout — a model call to any of these hung the turn until the sidecar restarted. Registration is removed until the host-tool pipeline is properly wired; the main-process executor stays in place.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Fixed a renderer crash (white screen) when opening the Agents or Diff workspace tab while the agent was running. Live subagent frames carry runtime statuses the panels' status table never mapped (`running`, `pending`, `aborted`, `parked`, `idle`), so `STATUS_META[status]` was `undefined` and reading `.live`/`.variant` off it tore down the whole React tree; progress payloads also arrived without the assumed shape, spraying `reading 'description'` errors mid-run. Status metadata now covers every runtime status with a safe fallback, "is this agent live" is a single shared predicate instead of scattered `status === "started"` checks, and each workspace panel is wrapped in an error boundary so a future panel-local failure degrades to an inline retry card instead of blanking the window.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Added the Electron desktop GUI with session navigation, conversation and tool rendering, model controls, settings, workspace panels, stats, light and dark themes, and compact-window support.
- Added voice features driven by the agent's speech/STT pipelines: a composer microphone (honors `stt.enabled`, `stt.modelName`, `stt.submitTrigger`, `stt.language`) that records, resamples to 16 kHz mono WAV, and transcribes server-side via the new `transcribe_audio` RPC, and auto-speak of assistant output (honors `speech.enabled`, `speech.mode`, `speech.voice`, `tts.localModel`) via the new `synthesize_speech` RPC with local TTS synthesis. Packaged builds carry the macOS microphone usage description and audio-input entitlement.
- Added dock/tray run progress honoring `terminal.showProgress`: dock badge (● working, ! waiting) and window progress bar, plus an amber waiting state in the tray icon.
- Added unified themes: the GUI now honors the agent's `theme.dark`/`theme.light` theme names by resolving them server-side (`get_theme_colors` RPC) and layering the colors over the active GUI theme, re-applied on config updates and theme switches.
- Added a status footer bar honoring `statusLine.preset` (default/minimal/compact/full/nerd/ascii) with model + thinking level, cwd, context meter, and session name segments.
- Added compact density (`tui.tight`, root zoom) and a color-blind-safe palette (`colorBlindMode`, Okabe-Ito tokens) — both formerly TUI-only.
- The GUI now honors four settings that were previously TUI-only: `display.showTokenUsage` (per-turn usage row on assistant messages — note the schema default is off, so usage rows now follow the setting and stay hidden until enabled), `display.collapseCompacted` (pre-compaction history folds behind an expandable divider), `tui.titleState` (run-state marker in the window title: `●` working, `!` waiting on you, `›` your turn), and `goal.statusInFooter` (composer goal chip).
- Added a signal light to session rows in the sidebar: a pulsing green dot for sessions that are currently running (live store state for the attached session, the session file's tail status for others), and a pulsing yellow warning when the attached session is blocked on a confirmation (plan approval, ask, or permission prompt) — visible at a glance while juggling multiple sessions.
- Added an explicit thinking-level picker in the composer (Codex/Claude Code style): the chip now opens a menu listing `off`, `auto`, and exactly the effort levels the active model supports, with the current selector checked — replacing the blind click-to-cycle that jumped to an unspecified next value. The get_state wire now carries `thinkingConfigured` and `availableThinkingLevels`, and `set_thinking_level` accepts `auto`.
- Added a Settings → GUI toggle to expand reasoning (thinking) blocks by default; blocks can still be collapsed individually and the preference persists across launches.

### Fixed

- Fixed settings edited from the GUI settings window not taking effect in the running session for runtime-cached keys (sampling parameters, default thinking level, advisor, memory backend, vision mode, provider search/image orders, MCP notifications, conversation-flow modes, omit-thinking, mermaid prompt refresh) — `set_setting` now applies them live via the shared runtime-apply path.
- Fixed the settings window showing stale values after a setting was changed elsewhere (TUI, composer controls, another window); it now refreshes on config_update while open, without clobbering an in-progress row edit.
- TUI-chrome-only settings (status line, terminal images, boot screens, speech/audio, …) are now badged "TUI only" in the settings window so it's clear they have no GUI effect.
- Settings cached at session construction (tool/prompt registration, thinking budgets, autolearn, LSP pool, …) are now badged "restart required" — edits take effect after a sidecar restart in every client.
- Fixed `plan.defaultOnStartup` never applying to GUI sessions, and closed todos never auto-clearing (`tasks.todoClearDelay` now runs in the agent session, not the TUI).
- Fixed the chat showing no feedback while the agent was busy but nothing had streamed yet. A live status row now mirrors the TUI's loader line: waiting for the model's first event (elapsed seconds, escalating slow-response hint after 30s), auto-retry delay/attempt with a live countdown and failure detail, and auto-compaction maintenance with the TUI's reason/action text — each carrying an Esc-interrupt hint. The row also appears when attaching to a session that is already streaming (launch/reconnect/session switch), and stays visible through the user-prompt echo and the empty assistant shell that precede the first streamed token.
- Fixed the composer sending the message when Enter was pressed while an IME candidate window was open (e.g. Chinese pinyin); Enter now commits the composition instead.
- Fixed packaged applications crashing at startup because main-process dependencies were externalized while `node_modules` was excluded from the application archive.
- Fixed RPC extension UI subscriptions so interactive ask and approval dialogs appear and return user responses.
- Fixed historical tool calls and results rendering as empty assistant messages after session hydration.
