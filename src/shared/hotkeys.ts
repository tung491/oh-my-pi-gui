/**
 * Chords owned by the native (main-process) layer: the app menu and the
 * system-wide window shortcut. Electron resolves these before the keydown
 * reaches any renderer, so a GUI action bound onto one of them can never fire —
 * the keymap registry therefore treats them as reserved and refuses the binding,
 * and the shortcuts dialog lists them alongside the remappable rows.
 *
 * This is the only place these chords are spelled out: `main/menu.ts` and
 * `main/index.ts` ask for the Electron accelerator by id, and the renderer
 * derives its display + conflict table from the same list.
